#DriverPass Project

## Summary

> Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

This project is a solution to provide a fictional company, DriverPass, with a system that allows them to manage internal employees, instructors, users, and driving lessons. The system is designed to be used by employees and instructors to manage their schedules and lessons, and by users to book driving lessons and manage their accounts. On top of that it should allow the company's secretary to manage and create appointments for users. 

They wanted me to design a web-application that would run on the cloud that would both users and internal employees to access the system. 

## Performance

> What did you do particularly well?

I believe I have met the requirements of the project adequately and have designed systems that seem to acheive the desired functionality. I have used a combination of various UML diagrams, and skills I learned through the course in-terms of the Software Development Life Cycle, to design the system. 

I believe the best part of my project is the use of all my UML Diagrams, I believe they are well designed and provide a good understanding of the system. I carefully thought out the system, the users, and the various purposes, and designed robust and releastic diagrams to represent the system.

## Self-Assessment

> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work to revise, I would choose to revise the use case diagram. I believe that the actors are poorly defined and are limited in the described use cases, for example, IT Admin should have much more use cases then just logging in. I would improve by taking more time to really think about each user and what they will do and how they will interact with the system.

## Methodology

> How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by researching and thinking about who the user is and what they would want to do with the system. I then designed the system to meet those needs. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because the system is designed to be used by the user, and if the system does not meet the user's needs, then the system is not useful. This is usually the falling point of many systems, they are designed without the user in mind, and thus are disfunctional, fustrating, and not used.
